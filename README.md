# Imagery

To deploy, please make sure the IMAGERY_VAULT_PASSWORD environment variable is
set.

## Dev setup
1. `git clone git+ssh://repository.parthenonsoftware.com/gitprojects/imagery`
2. From within imagery/ : `vagrant up && ./test_server.sh`
3. Point your browser at localhost:5000 .
4. Enjoy.

WARNING: for the moment, since the vagrant box has nothing else on it, starting
the dev server via ./test_server.sh kills all things python just to make sure
nothing else is listening on port 5000. This could be made less bad.

## Infrastructure that might need improving
* The credentials are stored in .json files under /srv/imagery_credentials .
  This seems very nonstandard, but some of the credentials are more than just
  one string, and the credentials have to be somewhere on the server where
  the app can get at them anyway. Not sure.
* The test server script could be generated by ansible or made into an ansible
  playbook.
